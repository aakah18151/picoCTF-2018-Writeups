Problem Statement (250 points):

There is a website running at http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:22430 (link). Try to see if you can login!
(a login.php was provided whicch you can find here)

Solution : 

From the php file i saw that there is a check for sql injections but it was only for $username the line was :

	$pattern ="/.*['\"].*OR.*/i";
	$user_match = preg_match($pattern, $username);
	$password_match = preg_match($pattern, $username);

you we can ddo sql injection in password to bypass but we have to find the username.

I tried with admin,Admin,ADMIN but Login failed appeared then i read the source again and see there  is is $database_file so tried with username : database and (password : ' or '1'='1). ' or '1'='1 is a very common SQL Injection .the username was a correct guess as the flag appeared :

Your flag is: <b>picoCTF{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_vau1t_06857925}</b>
