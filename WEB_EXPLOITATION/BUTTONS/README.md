Problem Name : BUTTONS
Problem statement (250 points):

There is a website running at http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:18342 (link). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

Hints given :

What's different about the two buttons?

Solution:

As i opened the websit a button with tag Push me was there and after pressing the button another window with opened with a hyperlink named as button2 was there but it was not a button.On clicking that i was redirected to some other page with no flag.So using the hint i saw the source code of 2nd page and tried to changed that hyperlink to a button format.

The orignal code was :

<div>
    You did it! Try the next button: <a href="button2.php">Button2</a>
</div>

and i changed it this way using code of button 1 just change the link in button1 source to button2.php: 
<form action="button2.php" method="POST">
    <input type="submit" value="PUSH ME! I am your only hope!"/>
</form> 

and after clicking the button i was awarded with flag :

Well done, your flag is: <b>picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_25a99f84}</b>
