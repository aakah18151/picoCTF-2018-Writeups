Problem Name : Secret AGENT
Problem statement (200 points):

Here's a little website that hasn't fully been finished. But I heard google gets all your info anyway. http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:3827 (link)

Solution:
When opened a website and clicked the button it says you are not google and then displayes browser name.So i have to change my user-agent to google bot.for this i used user-agent switcher(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/lkmofgnohbedopheiphabfhfjgkhfcgf) from chrome extensions and then from the extension i set my user-agent to GoogleBot.

After clicking the flag button the flag appeared :
