Problem Statement (150 points):

Tags : cookie sniffing

I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:6153

Solution :
In this we have to login as admin but we don't know tha password.

When I login with wrong creditentials a window opened with a user and it was written that you are not admin.I again went back to login and tried some sql injection but did not succeded.Then i saw the cookie , there was an admin cookie whose value was false, so using chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) i edit the value of admin cookie to True.

And then flag window appeared with flag : <b>picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_82e795f4}<b>
