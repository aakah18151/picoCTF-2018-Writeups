Problem name : NO LOGIN

Problem Statement(200 points) :

Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. http://2018shell2.picoctf.com:14664

Solution

As the problem name tells that there is no login option. There is sign in and sign out option but opening that redirects to same page with message : "I'm sorry it doesn't look like you are the admin. " 

So i created a new cookie with cookie name : "admin" and value : "true" using editthiscookie chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) and then refreshed the page 

Then the page reloded with flag : <b>picoCTF{n0l0g0n_n0_pr0bl3m_eb9bab29}</b>
